# WP-07 — QC Register Preparation & Portal Execution

**Architecture state:** YELLOW  
**Progress:** 50%

## Objective
Create the complete server preparation, verification, portal contract and execution pipeline for the QC Register stage.

## Milestones
- [x] Identify all QC Register source data requirements.
- [x] Audit existing SASV/server QC/lab data relevant to e-Aushadhi.
- [ ] Define manual-entry path for missing QC data.
- [x] Define canonical/portal terminology requirements.
- [x] Define attachments/evidence dependencies if any.
- [x] Capture portal QC Register page/field/network contract read-only.
- [x] Implement server preparation/readiness lifecycle.
- [ ] Implement operator client verification UX.
- [ ] Implement safe portal executor and reconciliation.
- [ ] Record server-side progress/audit.
- [ ] Representative product verification.
- [ ] WP closure audit.

## G0A — Portal contract capture
Read-only QC Register capture completed for Product 262 / Karpooradi Thailam.

Established native QC record contract:
- route: `/admin/addQCRegister`;
- QC-record Save handler: `SaveData()`;
- Save endpoint: `../admin/SaveQCData`;
- native list/reread/document helpers identified;
- Update/Delete exist in the portal but remain outside ordinary WP-07 execution authority;
- no portal mutation occurred during capture.

## G0B — Canonical source and gap contract
Completed.

The existing `regulatory.stability_study`, `stability_study_batch`, `stability_study_document`,
`approved_laboratory` and `QC_PROTOCOL` controlled-term foundation is retained as canonical QC source authority.

Frozen safety rules include:
- ordinary lab sample dates must not be inferred as stability Study Start/End dates;
- ordinary COA existence does not automatically create a QC Register record;
- Product Details, Composition and QC remain independent portal lifecycles;
- `portal_product_state.qc_status` is not QC execution authority.

## G1 — Server lifecycle architecture
Completed and frozen.

QC owns an independent product-level stage and per-record execution lifecycle.
One run authorizes at most one QC Register Save target.
Native reread and exact semantic proof are required before row verification.
Final QC-stage verification is separate from row execution and never authorizes final product Submit.

## G2 — Server foundation implementation
Implemented live on 2026-10-04, repository-versioned on
`feat/wp07-g2-qc-server-lifecycle`, and cleanly merged to `main` at
`efa8f33b44ade2574af8f8ade4d97ff4d88009a0` after a 0-behind/no-overlap guard.

Live migrations:
- `20261004151444_wp07_qc_server_lifecycle_foundation`
- `20261004151642_wp07_qc_snapshot_document_aggregate_fix`

Implemented:
- explicit `NOT_APPLICABLE` QC protocol term for portal `N/A`;
- explicit governed Other Testing Protocol text;
- captured QC protocol portal-option projections as DRAFT mappings pending governed verification;
- QC-specific approved-laboratory portal mapping authority;
- independent `regulatory.eaushadhi_qc_stage`;
- independent `regulatory.eaushadhi_qc_run`;
- server-generated QC snapshot/content hash;
- read-only QC execution preflight;
- bounded run-arm, Save-outcome, row-verification and final-stage-verification RPCs;
- explicit QC audit-event writes;
- no direct anonymous execution of QC lifecycle RPCs.

Post-merge verification:
- repository migration files exactly match live Supabase migration history;
- Product 262 Product Details and Composition remain unchanged;
- QC remains fail-closed with `READY=false` / `NO_GOVERNED_QC_RECORDS`;
- merge created no Product 262 QC source, stage, run or QC audit row.

Post-deployment proof:
- Product 262 Product Details remains `PORTAL_VERIFIED` at workflow row_version 11;
- Product 262 Composition remains `PORTAL_VERIFIED` at stage row_version 14;
- Product 262 QC snapshot is truthfully `READY=false` with reason `NO_GOVERNED_QC_RECORDS`;
- Product 262 has zero QC source study rows, zero QC stage rows and zero QC run rows;
- run-arm fails closed while QC READY is false;
- no QC portal mutation occurred.

## Current gate
**G3 — Representative Product 262 canonical QC data preparation.**

Prepare and govern the first real QC/stability record source data for Product 262 before any client or portal execution work.
The next gate must resolve the actual testing protocol, study dates, batch representation, report date,
IN/OUT classification, eligible report artifact and (for OUT) approved laboratory + portal mapping.

No QC portal Save/Update/Delete is authorized.
No final product Submit is authorized.
