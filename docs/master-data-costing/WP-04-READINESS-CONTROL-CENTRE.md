# WP-04 — Central Master Data / Costing Readiness Control Centre

## Objective
Audit existing SKU/status surfaces and establish an authoritative portfolio readiness/remediation capability only if justified. Reuse proven authorities and surfaces; no second readiness calculator.

## Authority and entry criteria
Live Supabase → current Git main → approved programme/WP MD → chat supporting context.

WP00–WP03 and the prerequisite control plane are completed and verified. WP03 remains COMPLETED, VERIFIED, MERGED AND CLOSED. Its merge `dd7da3a6fa2f447a71d92ca091f3d18921e32968` and verified feature tip `3894ce43798e4d9d919dfac54c8ab11aa7168733` are ancestors of the audited main. No demonstrated upstream regression was found; WP03 is not reopened.

Remote main was fetched through GitHub first, then `git fetch origin main` independently confirmed `47dcd80f69ca68fcca8f089bf40fa4099b376450`. It matched the entry reference. Dedicated branch: `docs/wp04-g0-readiness-control-centre-audit`, based on that exact main. Isolated fresh checkout; no existing checkout/worktree was modified.

Mandatory inputs read: MASTER_PROGRAMME, IMPLEMENTATION_RULES, WORKPACK_HANDOVER_TEMPLATE, this WP, PARKED_BACKLOG, CHANGELOG_DECISIONS, and closed WP03. WP00 dependency matrix was also consulted and reconciled against current source/live definitions. No repository AGENTS.md was found.

## Scope and explicit exclusions
G0 is a read-only repository/live audit plus documentation. No launcher tile, module, dashboard, queue, route mapping, schema, RPC, permission, business rule, bulk writer, activation rule, release, tag, merge, or production mutation.

Preserve distinct Product/SKU entities and lifecycle; new Manage Products SKU remains Inactive; explicit activation remains separate and ungated by readiness. Product Active does not imply SKU Active or Costing Ready. UNKNOWN is not READY; review stays review; missing evidence stays incomplete; BLOCKER/BLOCKED cannot be bypassed. No Product-wide READY calculation. Saved Product without SKU remains a legitimate incomplete entity state without a fabricated readiness verdict.

Malayalam-name mismatch, Product status choice at creation, and readiness-gated activation remain unresolved high-risk decisions, outside WP04. UX-P02→WP11; NAV-P01/NAV-P02→WP08; CSE-P01 and SEC-P01 stay parked.

## WP04-G0 — Current-state audit (2026-10-02)

### Existing client surfaces
| Existing surface and source | Portfolio/queue behaviour and authority | Reuse boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manage Products, `manage-products.html`, `js/products.js` | Full Product catalog; saved Product’s SKU/Readiness lenses; per-SKU canonical LIVE_AS_OF calls; no-SKU guidance and master editor actions | Lifecycle anchor, not portfolio costing centre. Do not duplicate WP03 |
| Costing Control Center, `public/shared/costing-control-center.html`, `costing-suite-control-center.js` | Dashboard, Control Workbench, SKU Control Status; portfolio counts, material exceptions, primary control/route, secondary material evidence, exact frozen detail | Strongest existing central operational surface; snapshot costing control is not WP01 live readiness |
| Control Center selected-row foundation detail | `rpc_get_current_material_foundation_diagnosis(product_id,sku_id)`: current RM BOM and PM requirement presence | Supplemental CURRENT_SOURCE_STATE diagnosis, not readiness or approved frozen PM-BOM proof; no-SKU PM is NOT_EVALUATED_NO_SKU |
| Material Cost Manager, `costing-suite-material-cost.js` | Manual Rate Manager action queue/register/history; RM/PM trace; material acceptance writer | Existing specialist remediation, preserve its permission and exact evidence |
| Cost Sheet Review, `costing-suite-cost-sheet.js`, `costing-suite-shell.js` | SKU cost details/diagnosis, printable sheets, comparisons, scheme viability; cost confidence vs commercial viability | Existing downstream outcome/explanation, not entity lifecycle |
| QC and Materials/Stores queues, `costing-suite-qc-action-queue.js`, `costing-suite-materials-stores-action-queue.js` | Paged RPC-backed exceptions with recommended actions; Product-grain QC and SKU-grain MS | Specialist-owned follow-up and explain views; no central editing presumed |
| Production Route Manager, `costing-suite-production-route*.js` | Product route readiness, assignments, mapping/foundation review, cost centres, workload, draft/validate/submit/approve editors | Set-wise route readiness only; inherited approved family route can validly resolve |
| Pricing Policy Manager, `costing-suite-pricing-policy.js`, commercial-sales-assumptions and MRP modules | SKU overview; MRP reference readiness, proposals, decisions, application/history; selling/scheme policies; common/regional assumptions/defaults | Effective-dated specialist commercial authority, not Marketing evidence acceptance |
| Cost Build Manager, `costing-suite-cost-build.js`, driver-governance modules | Unmapped expense heads, unclassified staff, manual provisions, seven-element driver registry, policy lifecycle | Shared/global governance distinct from SKU remediation |
| PM BOM Manager, `manage-pm-bom.html`; Supply Batch Plan/batch-size references | PM authoring and frozen revision governance; preferred/min/max effective batch-size lifecycle | Foundation owners; row absence alone is not a universal readiness rule |
| MRP Master Data Console, `public/shared/mrp-master-data-console.html` | MOQ Policy, RM Form Conversion, Season Profiles, RM Seasonal Mapping registers | Procurement/planning master data; not a Product/SKU costing readiness centre |

`costing-suite-registry.js` and `costing-route-config.js` already register six Costing Suite modules and their lenses. Live `v_app_module_registry` proves the existing Control Center, Material, Cost Build, Pricing, and Cost Sheet routes for Electron/PWA. No new module is justified at G0.

### Existing server contracts and stored evidence
Inspected live pg_proc signatures/bodies, pg_views definitions, relation/column inventories, grants, view options, and targeted indexes.

| Contract/object | Grain/context | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public.rpc_get_product_sku_readiness(bigint,date,text,bigint)` | One SKU + explicit governed period + context type; exact run additionally pinned | Canonical multidimensional readiness, jsonb; no array/list/page argument |
| `rpc_get_latest_governed_cost_period_start()` | Governed period | Returned 2026-09-01 under verified authorized actor context |
| `costing.fn_product_sku_readiness_enrich`, `...run_evidence`, `...shared_issues` | SKU/run evidence plus valuation-date global policies | Seven driver dependencies, scheme, regional acceptance, shared issues; enrich summary on server |
| `costing.fn_resolve_sku_commercial_sales_basis_point` | SKU + period + valuation date | WP02 point lookup remains in live readiness. Multiple snapshot rows remain unresolved authority (CSE-P01) |
| `costing.v_current_successful_costing_refresh_run` | Latest SUCCESS with CAPTURED_AT_REQUEST per period | Existing snapshot reader context, not identically defined to readiness’s period+governed valuation SUCCESS selection |
| `public.v_costing_pricing_sku_control_status_snapshot` | Persisted SKU/period/valuation/run, current successful projection | Existing set-wise portfolio costing control. Joins DL and can overlay DIRECT_LABOUR_ROUTE_BLOCKED. Not full live master readiness |
| `costing.sku_costing_control_status_snapshot` | Frozen exact-run SKU | Unique period+valuation+run+SKU index; material, manufacturing, pricing, selling, outcome, first control, severity/route; monetary fields |
| `costing.costing_control_dashboard_snapshot` and public control-dashboard/business-KPI/dashboard views | Period/run summary | Existing counts/integrity/operational visibility |
| Material queue/drilldown, review-workbench summary/top-action/drilldown snapshots and public wrappers | Material/issue and affected Product/SKU/run | Existing portfolio remediation priority/impact evidence, not canonical readiness |
| `rpc_get_current_material_foundation_diagnosis` | Selected Product + optional SKU, current source | RM header/line counts and PM requirement count; separate from effective approved BOM revision |
| `rpc_get_qc_action_queue`, `costing.v_qc_action_queue_current` | Product/period/run | Paged exception contract; cost-sheet-review view permission |
| `rpc_get_materials_stores_action_queue`, `costing.v_materials_stores_action_queue_current` | SKU/period/run | Paged exception contract, max 500 rows; cost-sheet-review view permission |
| `rpc_get_regional_marketing_action_queue`, regional action snapshot/current view | SKU+region/period/run | Pricing-policy-manager view; assumption/basis actions, distinct from acceptance queue |
| `costing.v_regional_marketing_evidence_review_queue`, `fn_regional_marketing_review_status` | SKU+region+run/evidence fingerprint | Raw REVIEW_REQUIRED rows plus eligible fingerprinted acceptance yield effective status |
| `costing.rpc_accept_regional_marketing_review`, `regional_marketing_evidence_acceptance` | Exact evidence fingerprint, SKU+region | Costing-control-center edit; required reason, eligibility validation; no current-main invoking client found |
| PRM live/exact readiness RPCs, `fn_product_process_route_readiness` | Product/as-of or exact run; paged | Specialist set-wise contract, not whole Product/SKU readiness |
| Driver registry/detail RPCs and `v_cost_driver_policy_registry` | Global cost element/policy | All seven elements; shared issues must not be multiplied into fake SKU edit tasks |
| `costing_refresh_run`, stages, refresh status/context RPCs | Run/stage | Failures/context integrity and final run counts already stored; refresh writers were not called |
| Detailed-cost-sheet, status-diagnosis, Product summary and MRP reference-readiness views | Various Product/SKU/period projections | Existing specialist summary/diagnosis; not interchangeable with canonical live readiness |

There is **no identified set-wise full WP01 portfolio readiness contract** in live function/relation inventory or current consumers. Set-wise costing control, specialist route readiness and queues do exist. G0 creates no bulk contract.

### Canonical readiness unit and context
The assessment unit is **SKU + governed period + valuation/context semantics**, not Product-wide readiness or lifecycle Active. LIVE_AS_OF accepts one SKU, requires explicit period, reads governed valuation, rejects a refresh-run argument, and uses current master foundations with latest SUCCESS evidence matching period and valuation. Payload exposes `evidence_refresh_run_id` separately; requested `refresh_run_id` remains null.

EXACT_RUN requires a run, retains frozen evidence semantics, and does not substitute unfrozen Product/lifecycle truth. Persisted costing-control key is period+valuation+run+SKU. Regional acceptance additionally needs region and fingerprint. The Product without SKU has no assessment key; record its entity gap separately.

Existing snapshot reader chooses latest CAPTURED_AT_REQUEST SUCCESS per period; canonical readiness chooses latest SUCCESS matching current governed valuation. Both currently resolve September evidence to Run115, but G1 must preserve and explicitly reconcile those selectors rather than equating them by assumption.

### Queue field feasibility and state grouping
| Desired field | Existing authoritative support | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product/SKU identity and lifecycle | canonical context/identity/lifecycle; products/product_skus | Product no-SKU is an entity row, not a readiness result |
| Period, valuation, evidence run/context integrity | canonical context; governed-period RPC; exact snapshots | Must retain LIVE_AS_OF vs frozen outcome distinction |
| Overall severity and all five foundation/evidence/outcome dimensions | canonical summary | Not available together in current set-wise control view |
| Dependency code, status, applicability, owner, route, reason/note, evidence IDs | canonical dependencies/shared_issues | Owner/route are dependency-level; no single canonical row owner |
| First blocking dependency | dependency array and downstream first_control_status | No canonical “first blocking live dependency” scalar or approved cross-dimension priority. Do not manufacture one in JavaScript |
| Downstream control state | canonical downstream_control and persisted snapshot | Can be absent/UNKNOWN while current foundations block |
| Affected Product/SKU impact and action priority | existing specialist/material queues | Grain differs; cannot sum duplicate issues into fake portfolio totals |
| Age/staleness | snapshot_refreshed_at, run timestamps, material rate dates, acceptance timestamps | These are distinct clocks. No authoritative readiness issue first-seen age, SLA or stale threshold exists |

Display groups may use READY, REVIEW_REQUIRED, BLOCKED/BLOCKER, UNKNOWN while retaining raw server codes. Client request/load failure is separately Unavailable, never server UNKNOWN. NOT_REQUIRED/RESOLVED are dependency semantics, not portfolio READY votes. No client severity precedence, Product READY rollup, or rule selecting one of multiple commercial snapshot rows is approved.

### Live inventory and bounded proof
Project `qhmoqtxpeasamtlxaoak`; read-only observations on 2026-10-02. Every query used BEGIN READ ONLY and a 10-second statement timeout. Targeted permission-checking reads used transaction-local actor claim for the supplied actor after verifying existing permissions, then ROLLBACK. This is SQL audit evidence, not browser-session verification. No persistent permission/claim/data change.

| Population | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Products / Active / Inactive | 1342 / 639 / 703 |
| SKUs / Active / Inactive | 1793 / 637 / 1156 |
| Sample SKUs / active non-sample SKUs under Active Products | 29 / 611 |
| Products with no SKU / Active Products with no SKU | 516 / 54 |
| Active Products with no active SKU | 179 |
| Products / SKUs failing current basic master foundation predicates | 0 / 0 |
| Run115 control rows / READY / REVIEW_REQUIRED / BLOCKER / UNKNOWN | 636 / 489 / 147 / 0 / 0 |
| Active SKUs missing Run115 control / all SKUs missing Run115 control | 1 / 1157 |
| Material action queue rows, Run115 | 820, all REVIEW_REQUIRED / MATERIAL_RATE_REVIEW |
| QC action queue, September | 2 REVIEW_REQUIRED_QC_ABSORPTION_BASIS |
| Materials/Stores action queue, September | 2 REVIEW_MONTHLY_ALLOCATION_BASIS |
| Regional assumption action queue, September | 0 |
| Regional Marketing acceptance review rows, Run115 | 222, across 146 distinct SKUs; IK 95 / OK 127 |
| Acceptance review eligibility / accepted | 222 eligible / 0 accepted; all effective REVIEW_REQUIRED |

Run115 SUCCESS: September period, valuation 2026-09-10, finished 2026-09-27T21:00:00.058881Z. Latest Run116 FAILED at material stage: NO_EFFECTIVE_PM_BOM_REVISION, missing SKU114. Failed runs are excluded from readiness evidence selection.

Snapshot route distribution: COST_APPROVAL_WORKBENCH 489; COST_REVIEW_WORKBENCH 146; MATERIAL_RATE_REVIEW 1. Snapshot first controls: READY_FOR_COST_REVIEW 489; PRICING_BRIDGE_REVIEW_REQUIRED 143; PRIME_COST_REVIEW_REQUIRED 3; MATERIAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED 1. These are snapshot outcomes/routes, not canonical portfolio owner totals.

| Run115 dependency evidence code | READY | REVIEW_REQUIRED |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| DIRECT_LABOUR | 632 | 4 |
| PRODUCTION_OVERHEAD | 632 | 4 |
| QUALITY_CONTROL_OVERHEAD | 632 | 4 |
| MATERIALS_STORES_OVERHEAD | 634 | 2 |
| ADMIN_OVERHEAD | 634 | 2 |
| FINANCE_ADMIN_OVERHEAD | 634 | 2 |
| MARKETING_EXPENSE | 560 | 76 |

These direct persisted driver counts do not represent full live dependency frequencies; regional acceptance adds separate effective review evidence. Do not add the table rows to obtain unique affected SKUs.

Bounded canonical LIVE_AS_OF proof, all using September and null requested run:
- SKU11, Product14: Active, READY; all foundation dimensions RESOLVED; outcome READY.
- SKU10, Product14: Inactive, BLOCKER; master foundation RESOLVED but PM_BOM_REVISION, MRP_POLICY, SELLING_PRICE_POLICY and COMMON_COMMERCIAL_BASIS block; driver/scheme evidence UNKNOWN, outcome UNKNOWN.
- SKU42, Product51: Active, REVIEW_REQUIRED; REGIONAL_MARKETING_EVIDENCE owned by COSTING_CONTROL_CENTER / REGIONAL_MARKETING_REVIEW; foundation RESOLVED.
- SKU114, Product133: Active, BLOCKER, outcome UNKNOWN; same four blocking codes as SKU10; absent successful-run control.
- Across this deliberately selected four-SKU sample, each of those four blocking codes appears twice; regional acceptance review appears once. This is representative proof, not a random sample or catalog frequency estimate.

Full 1793-SKU LIVE_AS_OF READY/review/blocker/UNKNOWN totals and full canonical owner/route/dependency frequencies were **not safely obtained** because measured RPC cost makes an N-call census inappropriate. They remain an explicit G1 evidence/contract requirement. Snapshot counts must not be labelled those missing counts.

Historical refresh failures: 11 recorded failures, grouped as material stage 4, cost build 4, control maintenance 3. PM-BOM missing-revision failures recur in Run110 and Run116. Other recorded failures include FK constraints, ambiguous column, duplicate drilldown key, route context, DL pool mismatch and integrity checks; historical occurrence does not prove each defect remains current. No repair attempted.

### Performance and portfolio feasibility
Measured bounded `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for canonical SKU11 LIVE_AS_OF:
- Server execution 1762.132 ms; shared hit blocks 221199; shared read/dirtied/written blocks 0.
- One measurement, not a concurrency benchmark or guaranteed SLA.
- Illustrative serial multiplication: 637 active calls ≈18.7 minutes; 1793 calls ≈52.7 minutes if equal cost. These are extrapolations, not measured portfolio timings. Parallel fan-out would add load, not establish acceptable performance.

Measured existing set-wise snapshot severity aggregation: 3.29 ms, 1992 shared hit blocks. Different scope and semantics; it demonstrates inexpensive existing visibility, not equivalence to readiness.

Canonical RPC calls the Product-wide route readiness function then filters by Product, plus multiple effective resolvers, per-run evidence and shared driver evaluation. The route function is SQL STABLE SECURITY DEFINER with active-Product base; actual predicate pushdown/internal bottleneck was not isolated. Shared/global evaluation also repeats per call. Context/SKU indexes exist; their presence does not make full RPC fan-out cheap.

Manage Products currently uses Promise.all over only the selected Product’s SKUs. Do not expand that pattern to the whole catalog. Preserve the existing commercial-sales point helper and CSE-P01 multi-row uncertainty. No old full commercial-sales scan is reintroduced. A performant **server-side portfolio contract is likely required** for full live readiness, subject to G1/G3 design/review; wrapping N unchanged calls is not proven sufficient. Existing snapshots alone can support only their accurately labelled control scope.

### Permission findings and Marketing placement
Canonical readiness is SECURITY DEFINER with explicit auth.uid and either manage-products view OR costing-control-center view. EXECUTE grants inspected: authenticated and service_role (plus owner), not PUBLIC/anon. Narrow readiness visibility does not authorize monetary cost views or mutations.

Control Center snapshot wrapper is security_invoker=true, authenticated SELECT with explicit costing-control-center view filter (privileged audit roles separately allowed). Monetary fields exist; do not copy that payload into Product-only access without authorization design.

QC/MS reads require cost-sheet-review view. Regional assumption action queue requires pricing-policy-manager view. Marketing acceptance requires costing-control-center edit and server eligibility/fingerprint/reason. Existing supplied actor has view/edit for all seven inspected modules; no permissions were changed. View-only/denied browser journeys were not manufactured.

UX-P01 is confirmed: no current-main client invocation of Marketing acceptance or regional queue RPC outside generated types was found. Readiness visibility can show Marketing evidence centrally, but acceptance is a specialist governed mutation distinct from assumption/default editing. G2 should compare existing Control Center follow-up versus a later WP05–WP07 specialist acceptance surface; no placement or editor is approved in G0.

**New parked security finding SEC-P02:** regional evidence-review view grants authenticated SELECT, costing schema grants authenticated USAGE, view lacks security_invoker=true and module predicate; underlying review-status helper is SECURITY DEFINER without its own permission check. View includes monetary fields. This differs from narrow nonmonetary readiness authorization. Record for dedicated access/exposure/policy audit before direct reuse; this audit does not prove configured Data API schema exposure or test an unauthorized user. No grant/RLS/view change is made.

### Central remediation boundaries
| Boundary | Meaning | G0 treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prevent | Existing server validation at save/lifecycle | Preserve; no new activation or required-field rules |
| Guide | WP03 saved-entity/per-SKU guidance and master dialog actions | Closed upstream; preserve |
| Central Visibility | Cross-Product status/context/owner/impact follow-up | Reuse existing evidence where its semantics fit; full-live contract unresolved |
| Navigation | Proven existing module/lens destinations | Inspect only; no mappings/links added |
| In-module remediation | Existing master editors or owned material workflows | Stay under current owner and edit permission |
| Specialist | PM BOM, batch, route, pricing, drivers, QC/MS, Marketing acceptance | Safe descriptive code/status/owner visibility; central editing not presumed |
| Bulk Remediation | Multi-entity mutation, approval or evidence rewrite | No generic bulk remediation contract identified; high-risk and excluded |

Existing Stage-05 `costing-suite-recommended-ui-route.js` proves a **partial** route resolver: Production Route Manager, conditional material manager, material review, and pricing-review workspace destinations. COST_APPROVAL_WORKBENCH and unknown tokens stay non-navigable; COST_REVIEW_WORKBENCH is not handled. This does not supersede NAV-P02: canonical WP01 route vocabulary is not fully mapped, and Manage Products specialist routes intentionally remain text. Current-foundation RM_BOM_MANAGEMENT/PM_REQUIREMENT_MANAGEMENT are explicitly unverified in Control Center. No URLs are invented.

### Placement comparison (recommendation only)
| Option | Evidence | G0 assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extend existing Costing Control Center | Already portfolio/queues/control context and permissions | Best candidate for G2 comparison; no approved design yet |
| Extend Product/Master Data area | Catalog reaches Product users and zero-SKU entities | Could expose nonmonetary entity gaps; preserve lifecycle anchor and avoid duplicate costing authority |
| Embed readiness queue in existing surface | Shared context and proven remediation destinations | Plausible after performant contract/permission review |
| Reuse existing queue/control only | Fast and operationally established | Adequate for frozen downstream control; misses inactive/new SKU foundations and Product no-SKU population |
| New top-level module | No gap demonstrated that requires a new launcher destination | Not justified; DEC-005 reserves this until WP05/WP07/WP08 evidence or explicit superseding decision |

### Classification
- **REQUIRED NOW:** entry reconciliation, surface/contract/key inventory, bounded counts, authority/context differences, performance/permission limits, durable gate ledger. Completed at G0.
- **FUTURE DEPENDENCY:** G1 portfolio population/context/contract; G2 placement/remediation model; G3 package decomposition. Full canonical severity/owner/frequency census requires safe portfolio retrieval. Marketing acceptance placement remains UX-P01.
- **HIGH-RISK:** any new/changed server contract, set-wise authority/aggregation semantics, authorization, RLS, schema/index/view changes, central writers, top-level module, cross-module architecture, issue priority/age rules. Separate Plan → ChatGPT review → Implementation.
- **PARKED:** UX-P01, UX-P02, NAV-P01, NAV-P02, CSE-P01, SEC-P01; new SEC-P02 access audit.
- **OUT OF SCOPE:** production mutations/repairs, activation policy, Malayalam/status harmonisation, aesthetic hardening, broader launcher/navigation redesign, historical rewriting, e-Aushadhi.

## Approved design / contract
None. Findings and recommendations above do not lock architecture. CHANGELOG_DECISIONS.md unchanged.

## Proposed gate sequence
The original skeleton had unnumbered audit, contract, implementation, focused verification, independent audit, merge and handover milestones. The sequence below refines it because the audited full-live contract/performance gap needs explicit contract, IA and package gates; conditional server work remains separately reviewed.

| Gate | Scope/status |
| --- | --- |
| WP04-G0 — Entry criteria / current-state audit | [x] COMPLETED AND VERIFIED at audit/documentation level |
| WP04-G1 — Portfolio readiness contract | [ ] Define population, context/keys, field semantics, retrieval/performance, counts and authorization proposal; no implementation |
| WP04-G2 — Control-centre information architecture / remediation model | [ ] Compare reuse/embedding, specialist and Marketing placement, proven navigation; design review, no implementation |
| WP04-G3 — Server/client package decomposition | [ ] Exact files/contracts/tests; separate high-risk plan approval before execution |
| WP04-G4 — High-risk server package, if required | [ ] Conditional; implement only reviewed/approved package, with canonical equivalence/performance/permission proof |
| WP04-G5 — Client implementation | [ ] Bounded reviewed contract; autonomous routine work only where applicable |
| WP04-G6 — Independent implementation audit | [ ] Audit pushed implementation, consolidate corrections |
| WP04-G7 — Authenticated/live verification | [ ] Context, severities, permissions, specialist destinations, performance; no manufactured production test data |
| WP04-G8 — Merge/post-merge closure and final handover | [ ] Explicit approval required; update progress only after verified closure |

## Current Gate
`WP04-G0 — Entry criteria / current-state audit`

## Gate Status
[x] COMPLETED AND VERIFIED at audit/documentation level. WP04 remains active and incomplete; G1 has NOT STARTED. Branch unmerged.

## Required to close
G0 evidence and classifications are recorded. Full canonical census is explicitly unavailable at safe G0 cost, not silently replaced with snapshot counts. No architecture approval or functionality is implied.

## Next gate
`WP04-G1 — Portfolio readiness contract`. Planning/review only: establish a canonical, performant portfolio read contract and population/context rules from this evidence. Do not implement it in the G0 pass.

## Server changes
None. No production INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, DDL, migration, RLS/grant, acceptance, refresh request or other writer.

## Client changes
None.

## Tests / verification
- Remote main and local origin/main reconciled to exact entry SHA; WP03 tip ancestor check passed.
- Source audit of mandatory governance files and current consumers; live pg_proc/pg_views/catalog/grants/index audit.
- Read-only master, run, control, driver and queue counts; bounded canonical SKU11/10/42/114 proof.
- Canonical versus snapshot-context selector difference preserved; sample114 demonstrates population/outcome gap.
- Bounded timing as recorded; no full N-call census/load test.
- Documentation diff/whitespace and changed-file scope checked before commit; committed/pushed branch will be independently read back.
- No application tests required for documentation-only change; no new tests mirroring docs.

## Risks and unresolved questions
1. G1 must define which populations are assessed: all existing SKUs, active subset, samples, inactive parents, and separate no-SKU entities. Route readiness currently uses Active Products; G0 does not reinterpret inactive lifecycle results.
2. Can server retrieval share route/global-policy/context evaluation and preserve exact single-SKU equivalence without rebuilding business rules?
3. How should full LIVE_AS_OF dimensions be paired with persisted outcomes and missing-run coverage, with explicit current-success selector differences?
4. No canonical first-live-blocker scalar/priority or readiness issue-age authority exists; any proposed rule needs review.
5. Marketing acceptance has distinct permissions and monetary evidence; SEC-P02 must be considered before direct view reuse.
6. Existing partial route maps do not establish full WP01 navigation continuity.
7. Snapshot READY is not live READY; absence is not READY; failed refresh must not erase last-success proof.
8. Performance measurement is bounded and single-user; no approved SLA, concurrency proof or full census yet.

## Parked discoveries
SEC-P02 added to PARKED_BACKLOG.md; existing items unchanged. No new decision approved.

## Exit criteria / final handover
WP04 is not complete. Stop after G0. Unmerged audit branch contains this document, minimal MASTER_PROGRAMME active-state update, and the new parked security finding only. No tag/release/merge or branch cleanup.

Workflow: audit → contract/plan review for high-risk → package decomposition → approved implementation → independent audit → authenticated verification → explicit merge/post-merge closure.
WP progress: G0 closed at audit level; later gates not started.
Programme progress: 4 of 13 unchanged.
Current gate: WP04-G0 completed.
Next: WP04-G1 portfolio readiness contract.
Parked: UX-P01/02, NAV-P01/02, CSE-P01, SEC-P01/02.
Locked: server readiness authority, lifecycle separation, fail-closed evidence, governed context, specialist ownership and no new top-level module without later IA evidence.
